// Shared GitHub Actions pin assertions.

// Two prior incidents shaped this file. #162 and #178 both broke a Dependabot
// bump because a test froze one literal commit SHA, and the fix for #162 left a
// looser pattern behind: /[0-9a-f]{40}\b/ matches `@<sha>-evil`, `@<sha>/evil`,
// and `@<sha>.evil` too, because \b sits between the last hex digit and the
// punctuation. Those are all mutable refs a fork can move. So the rule here is
// "the whole ref token is exactly 40 lowercase hex characters", checked
// positively over every external `uses:` in the file rather than by blacklisting
// `@vN`.
//
// The refs are read from the parsed YAML document, not by scanning lines. A
// line scanner is defeated by valid YAML: `- { uses: attacker/action@main }` in
// flow style has no `uses:` at line start, and a `run: |` block scalar can
// contain text that looks exactly like a pinned step. Both were found by review
// against an earlier line-based version of this file, and actionlint accepted
// the crafted workflow, so this is reachable YAML rather than a hypothetical.
