# WP13 release readiness — pending integration

Status: **NO-GO for release until the gates below complete.** This is a live
readiness record, not evidence that the PRs or package are already released.

## Source and scope

Development candidate at WP12s close: b1432ba38b377d8732d94a9e17301e94eb988a03.
Release preparation is on codex/prod-wp13-release; new CLI/provider-auth correction
and bounded installed-artifact UI observation need their own final-head checks.
Do not reuse b143 as proof of those changes. Main owns all mutations.

## Current layer proof, before merge

All18 PR heads and associated full-CI runs were read live and matched exactly.
The historical job count grows with the implemented workflow; this is not a claim
that every early layer had the later six-job matrix. Current cumulative b143
passed all6 jobs and266 E2E cases. Re-read heads/checks/reviews before any merge.

Native stack216 contains199,198,200–213,215;215 is still draft.217 is a separate
manual child. Native-stack operation is gated on the explicit owner answer; do
not infer it from a general merge request. No stack membership changes proposed.
199 and198 are prerequisite/docs; the remaining16 are implementation layers.
Release-prep/promotion PRs do not pad that count.

Snapshot sources: ignored wp13/pr-preflight.json and ci-preflight.json. Merge SHAs
will be written only after actual readback and fresh origin/dev ancestry proof.

## Baseline and rollback

- main/preview: d2afe6b2aa7d006e2cd9765aa632714f96435db2.
- dev:66a4f9989e14f8bacd657f7d6c7c82599ae8ecb4 (approved history prerequisite214).
- Stable registry/GitHub Release:v3.13.1; preview version
  3.13.1-preview.260904.33885929065.1 identifies the same d2afe6b2 source.
- Previous stable integrity:
  sha512-88C+Y0+ImW4Huh+ECfCOunuDFgp17OYZcuSE7Y4NoaH4GmlezkXcyaR//DU6hdhEz1MhCMgn/2L7O6Ig3mgwtg==.
- Package rollback is reinstalling that immutable version; no tag rewrite or
  silent latest rollback. Pages is forward-repair-only under its latest-bound
  compatibility gate. User media/config are never rolled back/deleted.

## Remaining GO gates

1. Bounded release-prep CLI correction and UI helper verified on their actual
   final head, including original provider error identity and reserved/generic
   auth safety. Candidate UI exercise is not published proof.
2. Resolve actual review comments; no unresolved reachable High/Critical issue.
   WP12 triage remains applicable only where source is unchanged.105 was repaired
   and its residual warning owner-authorized after b143 tests;106 source-fixed.
3. Native operation authority, all current layer heads/checks/ancestry and review
   state. Then bottom-up actual merges into dev, with >=10 implementation receipts.
4. Release-prep child and dev->main promotion reviewed and merged normally.
   main must contain dev/preview. Freeze the exact integrated main SHA.
5. Canonical release.yml cut (planned minor from observed3.13.1, not a pre-minted
   version), candidate CI, preview publish/proof, allowed stable environment
   approvals, stable publish and GitHub Release. No direct npm publish.
6. Exact stable/preview metadata, tag/main/dev/preview, artifact SHA-512 and signed
   original publisher provenance. Existing finalizers must actually pass.
7. Published-kind installed UI smoke with driver/product identity kept distinct;
   original screenshots directly read. Actual deployed Pages workflow and
   installer byte/hash parity with that release source.

## Evidence discipline

P preflight:34 release-contract tests and pinned-toolchain check passed. Baseline
guard correctly refused this feature checkout; no release-ready claim follows.
Future identifiers are pending, not fabricated receipts. No paid generation,
personal app/account/3333 probes, forced shared refs, branch deletion, rule bypass,
new testing platform or **heartbeat automation**. Source-only judgments and
synthetic-provider UI evidence are not live provider/deployment proof.
