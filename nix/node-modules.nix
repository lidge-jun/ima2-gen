# node_modules built reproducibly from the committed lockfiles, via
# importNpmLock — no `npm install`, no npmDepsHash to maintain (it uses the
# integrity/SRI hashes already present in package-lock.json).
#
# There are two npm projects: the root server/CLI and the Vite frontend under
# ui/. Each gets its own node_modules derivation.
#
# NOTE on the node version: importNpmLock's npmConfigHook compiles native
# modules (better-sqlite3) against the *default* `nodejs` it is called with —
# not a version injected into buildNodeModules. Whoever consumes these
# derivations must run them on the SAME `nodejs`, or better-sqlite3 crashes at
# `new Database()` with a NODE_MODULE_VERSION ABI mismatch. callPackage injects
# pkgs.nodejs here, matching the hook default; keep it that way.
